# Factorial compression and strict interlacing

For integers `N ≥ 1` and `0 ≤ ell ≤ N`, factorial compression rescales the
coefficient of `x^k` by

`(N-k)! / (N+ell-2k)!`

on its natural support.  If a degree-`N` polynomial has positive leading
coefficient and all roots strictly negative, then the compressed polynomial
and the compression of the adjacent differential step have the exact floor
degrees predicted by the parameter `ell`, have simple strictly negative roots,
and are strictly interlacing with no common root.

The proof factors the compression through a finite Schur--Szegő multiplier,
identifies the degree-changing kernel, establishes its negative-root geometry,
and transfers strict interlacing through the multiplier.  A companion theorem
records the adjacent-degree two-branch gamma lifting used in applications.
